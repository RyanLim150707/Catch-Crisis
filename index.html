          <p>Hi my name is Jason McCoy. I'm 24 years old and the reason why I open-sourced this game is because ever since my dad had a stroke causing him to have expressive aphasia, I didn't have time to commit to this project. I wanted to share this with the world, but I didn't want to pollute the app store with low quality content, so I ultimately decided to let the world play my game if they wanted to, for free.</p>

<p>CATCH CRISIS IS A FUN, ADDICTING, AND CUTE OPEN-SOURCE ARCADE GAME TO TEST YOUR SPATIAL VISUALIZATION ABILITY, REACTION TIME, AND HAND-EYE COORDINATION.</p>

<p>A lot of work went into making this game and I would appreciate that if you like this game, please share it with everyone. I hope you’ll have as much fun with this game as did I making it. Below is a video of what I have so far!

<p><strong>Story</strong>:</p>

<p>Here tells the story of a brave hero or heroine who has come to help rescue the beautiful damsel in distress as the evil villain placed her in a dire predicament!</p>

<p>The objective of this game is for the hero to catch the falling Coins so that he/she is able to save up his coins in order to pay off the villain in return for her safety. In doing so, he must go through several grueling and humiliating trials just for the sake of her safe return. Throughout the entirety of the game, you must collect enough coins (or other falling objects corresponding to the level theme) to first unlock certain costumes in the shop and then keep playing the game collecting coins in order to unlock the levels.</p>

<p>Finally, when all the levels have been completed, the final stage will be unlocked allowing you to finally save her/him (please don’t be another side-scrolling ending!). Although, you may also choose to pay real money in exchange for virtual coins in order to save her faster (but where’s the fun in that!?). Throughout the gameplay, the player has 3 lives. If he/she misses the falling object 3 times in total the game will end and the total amount of coins earned will be displayed.</p>

<p>Randomly throughout the game, the player will encounter a wildcard falling item, a lottery ticket earning him/her 2 times points. When collected, every falling object must be collected without being missed or else the game ends and the 2x points collected will not count.</p>

<p>The player may choose to intentionally not catch the wildcard lottery ticket. If the player does not choose to catch the wildcard lottery ticket, no point reduction or loss of lives will occur.</p>

<p>“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while and that’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things.”</p>

<p>– <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>
